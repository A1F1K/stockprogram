# Yahoo has discontinued the ability to download stock prices from their website, this program doesn't function.

Run main.rb to set up your stock following profile based on the config files 'tickers.cf' and 'financials.cf'

Config file syntax:
  Put tickers, or financials all on one line seperated by spaces: 
    ex. AMD NVDA MSFT
    ex. o p m2

Have a look at table.txt for a list of all available options to be displayed.

May be adding stuff to this soon, RSS Feed for the stocks you've selected, stuff like that. Probably not.
